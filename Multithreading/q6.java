/*
ðŸ”¹ How can Thread-1 run "again" before Thread-0 wakes up?

Think of it like this:

At t = 0 sec:

Thread-0 runs â†’ prints 1 â†’ goes to sleep for 1 sec.

Scheduler switches to Thread-1.

Thread-1 runs â†’ prints 1 â†’ goes to sleep for 1 sec.

ðŸ‘‰ Now both threads are sleeping until t = 1 sec.

At t = 1 sec:

Both Thread-0 and Thread-1 become ready (they wake up almost together).

But only one can run first â†’ scheduler decides randomly.

Suppose CPU picks Thread-1 first â†’ it prints 2 and sleeps again.

Then CPU gives time to Thread-0 â†’ it prints 2 and sleeps again.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why sometimes you see order like 0 1 1 0.
