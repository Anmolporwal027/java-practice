// example showing the concept of MultiThreading 
/*
Example timeline in your code:

obj1.start(); â†’ A new thread for obj1 is created and starts running run().

Thread.sleep(1000); â†’ The main thread pauses for 1 sec, but obj1 keeps running during this time.

After 1 sec, obj2.start(); â†’ Now second thread starts.

Again main sleeps for 1 sec, but obj2 continues running.

Then obj3.start(); is called, same process.

ðŸ”¹ Important conclusion:

ðŸ‘‰ sleep() does not stop all threads.
ðŸ‘‰ It only pauses the thread that calls it. In your case, thatâ€™s the main thread.
